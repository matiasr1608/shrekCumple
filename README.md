## Personal project for my bithday :cake:

I wanted to do a **Shrek themed party**, so I made this website to let my friends and family choose the character they wanted to be.

It had a date where the option to take a character was open an everyone was able to do it at the same time, so there was peolple wanting the same character but the first one that was able to get it would take the character.

### Backend
The backend it's made using Google Appscript in a Google Sheet.

### Frontend
I used Boostrap 5 and some css of my own.
